How to assemble the parts!

Where to start? 

Mount the FRAME
1. Mount all M3 nuts into all connectors first frame_connector.stl, each connector should have 6pcs M3 Nuts
2. Takae the frame-connector and connect to frame_section_2.stl with M3x10 mm screws. Screw in all three holes. 
3. The the next frame_section_2.stl and use with M3x10 screws. Screw in all three holes. 
4. Thake a new frame_connector.stl, eac connector should have 6 pcs m3 nuts. 
5. Attach the new frame_connector.stl with the frame_section_2 that is already there. 
6. Take left_frame_section_3.stl and connect it to the the new frame_section_2.stl with M3x10 in three screw holes. 
7. Attach a new frame_connector.stl on the opposite side. 
8. REPEAT EXACTLY THIS ONE MORE TIME - and you will have to identical sides 

Mount the Two frames together
1. Take cross_bar.stl and mount to one side with a M3 nuts and M3x10 screw 
2. Mount all 4x cross_bar.stl with M3 and M3x10 screws. 

Mount the motor
1. Take the motor and place it in the big hole with the axle at the center hole. 
2. Screw it with 4 screws - which size and with bricks. 

Mount the sides

Mount the camera-pole
1. Use the B nuts, c strings and D screws 
2. This is also questionable if we should use other screws for this part - i think the M3x10 screws will work for this part also. 

Mount the tower for laser 
1. Use the B nuts, c strings and D-screws. 
2. This is a real hazzle to mount the tower for the laser... needs improvement. 


1. Mount the Laser-pointer to the right mount. 12mm_Laser_Holder_for_Atlas.stl
2.
